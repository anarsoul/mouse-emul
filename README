mouse-emul is a tiny mouse emulator for mouse/touchpad-less devices.

It requires uinput support in kernel (CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT).

To compile and install it invoke:
	make all install

To start it invoke:
	mouse-emul [-d /dev/input/eventX,/dev/input/eventY,/dev/input/eventZ]
Where /dev/input/event{X-Z} is a device to use for input

Add -h argument to get the list of arguments.

Format of config file.

Each line should look like:
	<left-value>=<right-value>

Where <left-value> can be 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'lbutton', 'rbutton',
'mbutton', 'toggle', 'mod' (all without quotes). These are name of keys used to
emulate mouse, last two are 'switches' to mouse-mode, last one is for temporary
switching (i.e. press mod+left to move mouse cursor to left). Also <left-value> can be
a key name to translate into <right-value> key name (Usefull if you want
translate some key to another in mouse-mode). <right-value> is key name.

Invoke mouse-emul -l for list of supported keycodes.
